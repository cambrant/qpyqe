        <h2>What is PyQe?</h2>

        <p>
          PyQe (Python Quick Execute) is a small (&lt; 10 Kb) Python
          program that uses Tkinter, Python's standard GUI toolkit, to
          let the user launch (execute) commands and programs from a
          pre-defined list of commands, just by entering a few
          characters.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wrote it because I could not find any really simple,
          keyboard driven program launcher to use under GNU/Linux that
          worked exactly as I wanted (I tried quite a few, but all of
          them didd something that annoyed me or did not work the way
          I wanted).
        </p>

        <p>
          PyQe is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
          which means that it is Free software (both free as in free
          beer and free as in freedom).
        </p>

        <h2>Starting PyQe</h2>

        <h3>Linux</h3>

        <p>
          The suggested usage is to tell your window manager to run
          pyqe on a certain keypress. How this is done depends on the
          window manager. If you cannot configure your window manager
          to do it, a program like xbindkeys can be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          pyqe comes with a sheband (#!) at the beginning of the
          file. By default it uses this line to start:
        </p>

        <pre>
          #!/usr/bin/env python
        </pre>

        <p>
          If that does not work on your set up you have to change it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If for some reason it does not work to execute pyqe
          directly, or if you do not want to make the script
          executable, start it in this way:
        </p>

        <pre>
          python path_to_pyqe/pyqe
        </pre>

        <h3>Windows</h3>

        <p>
          In Windows, the easiest way to start pyqe is creating a
          shortcut on your desktop containing the following "command
          line":
        </p>

        <pre>
          PATH_TO_PYTHON\pythonw.exe PATH_TO_PYQE\pyqe
        </pre>

        <p>
          Next, bind a keyboard combination to this shortcut by
          placing the cursor in the Shortcut Key field and pressing a
          keyboard combination, for example CTRL + SHIFT + P.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another way to do it is to place the same shortcut directly
          under the Start Menu (you have to use the Classic look if
          you are running Windows XP), giving the shortcut a unique
          character as the first character of the file name, for
          example a hyphen (-). This way, all yu have to do is press
          the Windows key (this brings up the Start Menu), and press
          the hyphen (note you must release the Windows key for the
          Start Menu to open, and before you press -).
        </p>

        <h3>General</h3>

        <p>
          If you want to speed the startup a bit, you can add the -S
          option to the interpreter.
        </p>

        <h3>Command line options</h3>

        <p>
          From now and on I will assume you start pyqe as a executable
          script.
        </p>

        <p>
          pyqe understands a couple of command line options. To see
          them, do this:
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --help
        </pre>

        <p>
          When you have tested it for a while you might want PyQe to
          execute single matches automatically (so that you do not
          need to press enter when there is only one match left):
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --auto
        </pre>

        <p>
          If you want to control the number of visible items in the
          listbox (default is 4):
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --height 10
        </pre>

        <p>
          The width, in character, of the listbox (default is 40):
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --width 20
        </pre>

        <p>
          The default startup position of PyQe is 0,0. You can change this:
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --xpos 100 --ypos 100
        </pre>

        <p>
          By default, PyQe sorts the commands list. If you do not want
          this:
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --nosort
        </pre>

        <p>
          You can turn on debug (you must run pyqe.py from a terminal
          to see the output) if something seems wrong:
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --debug
        </pre>

        <p>
          If pyqe does not start fast enough for you, consider using
          the --listen parameter:
        </p>

        <pre>
          pyqe --listen
        </pre>

        <p>
          This will start pyqe in the background, listening for
          commands in a named pipe called ".pyqepipe" in your home
          diretory. The current commands are "quit", "open" and
          "reload"and can be sent to the program in the following way:
        </p>

        <pre>
          echo open > ~/.pyqepipe
        </pre>

        <h4>Listen-mode commands</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>open</b> - Open the GUI for executing a command. When a
            command is executed or the GUI closed by pressing Escape,
            it will go back to listen mode again. This is probably the
            command you will use the most.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>reload</b> - Reload configuration file.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>quit</b> - Quick the listening PyQe process.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Configuring PyQe</h2>

        <p>
          Configuring PyQe is easy. Create a text file called .pyqerc
          and place it in your HOME directory (pyqe will concatenate
          the value of your HOME environment variable with "/.pyqerc"
          to find it and, yes, it works on Windows too as long as you
          create the environment variable HOME and set it to he
          directory where .pyqerc is placed) and place each command on
          its own line, in the following format:
        </p>

        <pre>
          command_name command
        </pre>

        <p>
          command_name is the name that will be visible in the GUI and
          matched against when you type on your keyboard.
        </p>

        <p>
          command is the actual command to be executed (using Python's
          os.system() call).
        </p>

        <p>
          Examples of a valid configuration file under GNU/Linux:
        </p>

        <pre>
          # My own .pyqerc file

          xmms xmms &
          rx rxvt &
          emacs emacs &
          firefox /home/mathias/pgm/firefox/firefox &
          gnome-terminal /usr/bin/gnome-terminal &
        </pre>

        <p>
          Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
        </p>

        <p>
          On GNU/Linux, an ampersand (&) is needed to the command so
          that it is executed asynchronously (or else pyqe will not
          quit until the executed application is closed. It will hide
          the GUI though so it is not visible.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Examples of a valid configuration file under Windows:
        </p>

        <pre>
          # My own .pyqerc file

          notepad start notepad
          google start http://www.google.com
          firefox start firefox
        </pre>

        <p>
          (The start command on Windows is very useful and I recommend using
          it for starting programs.)
        </p>

        <p>
          You might wonder why I did not shorten the commands above,
          using for example "em" instead of "emacs", but that is
          usually not necessary as long as you do not have many
          commands beginning in the same letters. When you use pyqe
          with the configuration above, just typing "e" will be enough
          to run the emacs command. You name your commands as you
          wish, this works for me.
        </p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>

        <h3>Basic</h3>

        <p>
          After starting pyqe, you will be presented with the full
          list of pre-defined commands in a list box, and the cursor
          will be waiting for input in an entry field. You can now
          either select a command using the arrow keys (up/down) and
          pressing return, or start typing the first letters of the
          command you want to run, which will make the list of
          commands smaller. After executing the command with return
          (or when using the auto option, when only one item is in the
          list), pyqe will close. Pressing escape will also close the
          program.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> the command names are compared to user input in a case
          sensitive way, so "my_program" and "My_program" are different.
        </p>

        <h3>Tab expansion</h3>

        <p>
          If two or more currently matching commands have several
          leading characters in common, the user can expand the
          command to the longest common string. For example, if you
          have two commands starting with "play_" (let's say
          "play_music" and "play_movies"), first type "p" and, asuming
          you have no other command starting with "p", you can now
          press the Tab key to expand the entered command to
          "play_". It is easier to use than it is to explain, so try
          it out.
        </p>
